        <p>
        There are four main principles or pillars of object oritented programming: Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. 
        This article is a quick guide that goes over the aforementioned principles in a consise way.
      </p>

      <h1>Inheritance</h1>
      <p>In a Object-Oriented Programming language, we can inherit methods and attriutes from one class to another. This creates a relationship
      between the two classes â€” the original class and the class that's inheriting the original class. We call the original class the parent or superclass, whereas
      the inheriting class is called the child or subclass.

      <h2>Bracket Pair Colorizer</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Bracket Pair Colorizer</em> can highlight matching brackets in the editor, so developers can easily
        understand which 2 brackets belong to each other. By default <code>()</code>, <code>[]</code>, and <code>{}</code>
        are matched, but you can also configure custom bracket characters.
      </p>
      
      <h2>NPM</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>NPM</strong> is a super handy extension for VS Code that runs the npm scripts in your <code>package.json</code>
        file and also it validates the packages installed in your project, which are listed in the <code>package.json</code> file.
      </p>
      
      {/* ... (more content) ... */}
      
      <p>
        There are so many extensions on the VS Code Marketplace that are helpful when doing software development, but to find
        the best among them will take some getting used to. The list provided here includes some of the best extensions,
        and it will be updated regularly to add more extensions that may come in the future.
